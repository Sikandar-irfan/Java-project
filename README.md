1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sikandar-irfan/Java-Project.git
   cd Java-Project/TicTacToe
   ```

2. **Build executable JAR**:
   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   ```

3. **Run the game**:
   ```bash
   java -jar target/TicTacToe-1.0.0.jar
   ```

4. **Install on device** or emulator

### Automated Builds

This project uses GitHub Actions for automated builds. On every release tag, it automatically:

- Builds JAR file for cross-platform use
- Creates Windows EXE executable
- Generates Linux AppImage
- Builds macOS app bundle
- Compiles Android APK
- Publishes all artifacts to GitHub Releases

## Usage

### Desktop Version
1. **Launch the game** using one of the installation methods above
2. **Select game mode**: Choose between "Player vs Player" or "Player vs Computer"
3. **Enter player names** (for Player vs Player mode)

4. **Use buttons** to reset game or change mode

## Game Rules
- Players take turns placing X and O on a 3√ó3 grid
- First player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins
- If the grid is full with no winner, it's a draw
- In computer mode, the AI uses the Minimax algorithm for optimal play
